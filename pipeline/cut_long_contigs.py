# Program to cut long contigs into uniform size pieces before running vizbin
# USAGE: cut_long_contigs.py <input fasta> <length of pieces in bp> <output fasta>

# Note: there is currently a bug in this program that causes a little bit of sequence to be lost every time it is run.
# I'm not sure why this happens but we should try to work out what is going on.
