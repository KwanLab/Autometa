# Program to make a control assembly fasta for simulated metagenome datasets made by 'make_simulated_metagenome.py'.
# The control fasta contains all the contigs originally obtained from NCBI, and a table is also made that
# tells you which species/assembly each contig came from.  You can align simulated reads to this fasta file in
# order to find out which reads are really unique to certain species.  This information can be used later to determine
# the accuracy of assemblies and binning of the simulated reads.

# For now the paths are hardcoded - this is sort of prototype code
