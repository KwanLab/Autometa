// Nextflow Autometa Pipeline Configuration.
// To choose one of the availble profiles (standard, conda, cluster) you must pass
// in the the -profile argument. i.e. nextflow run autometa.nf -profile cluster
// You may also specify multiple profiles by separating their names with a comma.
// i.e. nextflow run autometa.nf -profile standard,cluster
// Note: Standard profile is implictly used if no profile is specified by the user.

  cluster {
    process.executor = "slurm"
    // queue is the slurm partition to use.
    // Set SLURM partition with queue directive.

    /* 
    ***IMPORTANT NOTES:***
    1. The pipeline must be launched from a node where the `condor_submit` command is available.
    2. The HTCondor executor for Nextflow does not support at this time the HTCondor 
    ability to transfer input/output data to the corresponding job computing node. 
    Therefore the data needs to be made accessible to the computing nodes using a 
    shared file system directory from where the Nextflow workflow has to be executed 
    (or specified via the -w option).
